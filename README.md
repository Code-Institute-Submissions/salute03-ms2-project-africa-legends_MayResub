### Validators

1. **HTML** [W3C HTML Validator](https://validator.w3.org/) Used to identify HTML errors. few errors were identified, which has to do with the modal form.
The text in the heading of the form and the label texts were not showing, which i fixed by sinmply changing the colors to black and i got this idea from slack.
Then i made a mistake in the input, i used type="name" instead of type="text".

2. **CSS** [W3C CSS Validator](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/) Used to identify CSS errors

### Testing

1. **amiresponsive** [Am I Responsive](http://ami.responsivedesign.is/) Used to test responsiveness across a range of devices.

2. **Developer Tools** Chrome, Firefox and Microsoft Edge, web dev tools using iPhone 6,7,8,x plus, smasung s and Ipad as toggle devices to test responsiveness.

3. **Mobile Devices** I used my Google Pixel 3a phone and Amazon Fire tablet to test the site, using this method I found that not all of the fonts were loaded properly originally.

4. **Friends and family** I asked for feedback from friends and family in order to get a users perspective and i got very good feedback.

5.**Lighthouse** A number of issues were resolved using lighthouse. I used lighthouse to determine the rate of performance, accessibility, best practice and SEO.


## Deployment

   My account url; https://github.com/salute03

6. To publish the project to see it on the web, I then went into the Settings on my respository, scrolled down to the heading, GitHub Pages.
