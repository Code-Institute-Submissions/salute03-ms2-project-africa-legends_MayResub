## Project Overview

This is a front-end web page for an outdoor fitness trainer based in Lagos Nigeria, Pelumi.  Pelumi is setting up his own business providing a range of personal training, group workouts and using sport as a mode of training.


He wanted a website that showcases what he offers to his clients and potential clients, how he can help his clients benefit from having a personal trainer, importance of yoga and how it greatly improves more than just flexibility & having fun.  
He want the gallery to showcase pictural representation of the of how his clients achieve their body goals following his training style and how he is uniting diffferent people with the same goals, there by creating friendship outside training.

This webpage was created as the first milestone project as part of the Code Institute ‘Full Stack Development’ course.  

The deployed version can be viewed at: https://salute03.github.io/milestone-1-project/

This is for educational purposes only.

## UX

Grow Kinesis is aimed at B2C users. This website is for Pelumi’s current & potential clients to see what services he provides and how he delivers his services. The services currently provided are personal training; either one to one or in a small group, yoga trainig and also, Using sport as medium of keeping his clients fit and happy. 

It will hopefully bring more clients who will be using more of his services to get the perfect body shape they want with sound and clear mind.  Personal training, yoga, football and basketball, workout drills.   


### UX Planes

### Suface

The website is designed with blended colors of Black, Green, White, red, two shades of lemon green and light gray. The colors were inspired from the backdround of the pictures.
I used Roboto font for the texts contents but made changes with <i></i> italics in some text content.
I used a dumbell icon from font awesome in the home page which links to the gallery page.
Opaque overlay is used to reduce the brightness of the background image in the first of the website which blended the black color of the navbars section and the benefit section.
Two of the testimonies are hidden on a mobile platform inorder not to make the mobile content too cumbersome.

#### Skeleton
Navigation Bar:
The fixed navigation bar allows users to navigate around the website with ease by clicking on the various pages. The hover selector changes this to light green when hovering over a page link. 
The navigational bar collapses down to a hamburger icon dropdown menu when in mobile screen size view. The name "G.R.O.W. Kinesis" is linked to the  home page to make is easier for the users to go back to home page without scrolling.
The dumbell image (font awesome) is a link to the gallery, while the sign up! button provides a form for sign up data.

Footer:
It contains the contact informations and location of Grow Kinesis.
it contains the social icons, which are ment to link to Pelumi's social media handles but it has not been provided at this time but when provided, they will be linked.
The logo in the footer is clickable and servers a navigation back to the top of the page from the footer.


#### Structure 

The home page is divided into five sections, 
1.The Navigation Bar which aids a smooth navigation from one page to another.
2.The First sight which holds the texts, form and a bumbell image that links to bthe gallery.
3.The benefits
4.The testimonies which contains the images of clients who have had a great expreince with Grow kinesis. 
5.The footer which contains the logo, contact informatons and social links.

The pictures in the gallery page are arranged to display in four columns on large devices and tablets but two columns on mobile devices. And each of the pictures can open in seperate pages across all devices. 

The About page contains Pelumi’s picture and texts of  his achivements and goals.

All these make the website very interactive.



#### Scope

Home page:
It is designed with a bold background image which covers the whole screen as the first sight of the web page and a bold sign up! button and form for prospective client.

Gallery page:
It showcases images from different training sessions with the current clients, the pictures are arranged using masonry syling. The pictures are clickable and each can open in a new page for better viewing across all devices.

About page:
It is focused on the trainer, Pelumi in which he expressed himself on his talents, passion, experinces, goals and his accademic achievement so as to inform prospective clients of his professionalism and a certified trainer.


#### Strategy

This website is basically designed to showcase what Pelumi offers his clients, which is fitness and healthy living and to attract more prospective clients.


### User Stories:

1.	A potential client looking for a local personal trainer can see what services are offered.
2.  A potential client can see the level of intense training provided.
3.  A potential client can see the importance of personal trainer.
4.  Its an avenue to be healthy and socialise at the same time.


### Design

A standard layout is fully responsive on mobile devices and larger screens.

### Validators

1. **HTML** [W3C HTML Validator](https://validator.w3.org/) Used to identify HTML errors. few errors were identified, which has to do with the modal form.
The text in the heading of the form and the label texts were not showing, which i fixed by sinmply changing the colors to black and i got this idea from slack.
Then i made a mistake in the input, i used type="name" instead of type="text".

2. **CSS** [W3C CSS Validator](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/) Used to identify CSS errors

### Testing

1. **amiresponsive** [Am I Responsive](http://ami.responsivedesign.is/) Used to test responsiveness across a range of devices.

2. **Developer Tools** Chrome, Firefox and Microsoft Edge, web dev tools using iPhone 6,7,8,x plus, smasung s and Ipad as toggle devices to test responsiveness.

3. **Mobile Devices** I used my Google Pixel 3a phone and Amazon Fire tablet to test the site, using this method I found that not all of the fonts were loaded properly originally.

4. **Friends and family** I asked for feedback from friends and family in order to get a users perspective and i got very good feedback.

5.**Lighthouse** A number of issues were resolved using lighthouse. I used lighthouse to determine the rate of performance, accessibility, best practice and SEO.

## Deployment

1. I Created a Github account at https://github.com
   My account url; https://github.com/salute03

6. To publish the project to see it on the web, I then went into the Settings on my respository, scrolled down to the heading, GitHub Pages. Under the Source setting, I used the drop-down menu to select master branch as a publishing source and saved it. Refreshed the github page, and you are then given a url where your page is published;
